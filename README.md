# Solar Inverter Monitor

This project is a simple monitoring system for solar panels. It uses an ESP8266 microcontroller to read data from the INA226
current and voltage sensor and LED output of solar inverter board. The data is then sent to the Home Assistant using MQTT.<br>
The project was created in PlatformIO 15.05.2023

## Build and settings
1. Install (if you haven't already) [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) extension for VS Code.
2. Create a copy of `platformio_override.ini.example` and rename it to `platformio_override.ini`.
3. Set your own values in `platformio_override.ini`.
4. Update hardware and other settings in `lib/defs/def.h` file if needed.
5. Build and upload the project to your ESP8266 device using PlatformIO.
